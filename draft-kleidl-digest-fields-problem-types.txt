1.  Introduction

   [DIGEST] by design does not define, require or recommend any specific
   behavior for error handling relating to integrity.  The
   responsibility is instead delegated to applications.  This draft
   defines a set of problem types [PROBLEM] that can be used by server
   applications to indicate that a problem was encountered while dealing
   with a request carrying integrity fields and integrity preference
   fields.

   For example, a request message may include content alongside Content-
   Digest and Repr-Digest fields that use a digest algorithm the server
   does not support.  An application could decide to reject this request
   because it cannot validate the integrity.  Using a problem type, the
   server can provide machine-readable error details to aid debugging or
   error reporting, as shown in the following example.

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/problem+json
   Want-Content-Digest: sha-512=3, sha-256=10

   {
     "type": "https://iana.org/assignments/http-problem-types#unsupported-hashing-algorithm",
     "title": "hashing algorithm is not supported",
     "unsupported-algorithm": "foo"
   }

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terms "integrity fields" and "integrity preference fields" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [DIGEST].

   The term "problem type" in this document is to be interpreted as
   described in [PROBLEM].

3.  Problem Types

3.1.  Unsupported Hashing Algorithm

   This section defines the "https://iana.org/assignments/http-problem-
   types#unsupported-hashing-algorithm" problem type.  A server MAY use
   this problem type when responding to a request, whose integrity or
   integrity preference fields reference a hashing algorithm that the
   server can not or does not want to support for this request, and if
   the server wants to indicate this problem to the sender.

   For this problem type, the unsupported-algorithm is defined as the
   only extension member.  It SHOULD be populated in a response using
   this problem type, with its value being the algorithm key of the
   unsupported algorithm from the request.  The response SHOULD include
   the corresponding integrity preference field to indicate the server's
   algorithm support and preference.

   The following example shows a response for a request with an
   integrity field utilizing an unsupported hashing algorithm foo.  The
   response also includes a list of supported algorithms.

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/problem+json
   Want-Content-Digest: sha-512=3, sha-256=10

   {
     "type": "https://iana.org/assignments/http-problem-types#unsupported-hashing-algorithm",
     "title": "hashing algorithm is not supported",
     "unsupported-algorithm": "foo"
   }

   This problem type is a hint to the client about algorithm support,
   which the client could use to retry the request with a different
   algorithm supported by the server.

3.2.  Invalid Digest Value

   This section defines the "https://iana.org/assignments/http-problem-
   types#invalid-digest-value" problem type.  A server MAY use this
   problem type when responding to a request, whose integrity fields
   include a digest value, that cannot be generated by the corresponding
   hashing algorithm.  For example, if the digest value of the sha-512
   hashing algorithm is not 64 bytes long, it cannot be a valid digest
   value and the server can skip computing the digest value.  This
   problem type MUST NOT be used if the server is not able to parse the
   integrity fields according to Section 4.5 of [STRUCTURED-FIELDS], for
   example because of a syntax error in the field value.

   The server SHOULD include a human-readable description why the value
   is considered invalid in the title member.

   The following example shows a response for a request with an invalid
   digest value.

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/problem+json

   {
     "type": "https://iana.org/assignments/http-problem-types#invalid-digest-value",
     "title": "digest value for sha-512 is not 64 bytes long"
   }

   This problem type indicates a fault in the sender's calculation or
   encoding of the digest value.  A retry of the same request without
   modification will likely not yield a successful response.

3.3.  Mismatching Digest Value

   This section defines the "https://iana.org/assignments/http-problem-
   types#mismatching-digest-value" problem type.  A server MAY use this
   problem type when responding to a request, whose integrity fields
   include a digest value that does not match the digest value that the
   server calculated for the request content or representation.

   Three problem type extension members are defined: the algorithm,
   provided-digest, and calculated-digest members.  A response using
   this problem type SHOULD populate all members, with the value of
   algorithm being the algorithm key of the used hashing algorithm, with
   the value of provided-digest being the digest value taken from the
   request's integrity fields, and the value of calculated-digest being
   the calculated digest.  The digest values MUST BE serialized as byte
   sequences as described in Section 4.1.8 of [STRUCTURED-FIELDS].

   The following example shows a response for a request with a
   mismatching SHA-256 digest value.

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/problem+json

   {
     "type": "https://iana.org/assignments/http-problem-types#mismatching-digest-value",
     "title": "digest value fromr request does not match expected value",
     "algorithm": "sha-256",
     "provided-digest": ":RK/0qy18MlBSVnWgjwz6lZEWjP/lF5HF9bvEF8FabDg=:",
     "calculated-digest": ":d435Qo+nKZ+gLcUHn7GQtQ72hiBVAgqoLsZnZPiTGPk=:"
   }

   If the sender receives this problem type, the request might be
   modified unintentionally by an intermediary.  The sender could use
   this information to retry the request without modification to address
   temporary transmission issues.

4.  Security Considerations

   Although an error appeared while handling the digest fields, the
   server may choose to not disclose this error to the sender to avoid
   lacking implementation details.  Similar, the server may choose a
   general problem type for the response even in a more specific problem
   type is defined if it prefers to hide the details of the error from
   the sender.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the following entry in the "HTTP Problem
   Types" registry:

   Type URI:  https://iana.org/assignments/http-problem-
      types#unsupported-hashing-algorithm

   Title:  Unsupported Hashing Algorithm

   Recommended HTTP status code:  400

   Reference:  This document

   IANA is asked to register the following entry in the "HTTP Problem
   Types" registry:

      digest-value

   Title:  Invalid Digest Value

   Recommended HTTP status code:  400

   Reference:  This document

   IANA is asked to register the following entry in the "HTTP Problem
