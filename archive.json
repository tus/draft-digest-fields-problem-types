So only a server can indicate to a client that something was wrong about the request itself (or that a problem occurred while processing the valid request).\r\n\r\nThe intro contains most of the right words but I think it can be improved a bit. I would break the final sentence of the first paragraph off, and expand on that some more. I'd delete some of the redefinition of things too, to cut down the text. For example,\r\n\r\n```\r\n[DIGEST] by design does not define, require or recommend any specific behavior for error handling related integrity. The responsibility is instead delegated to applications. This draft defines a set of problem types [PROBLEM] that can be used by server applications to indicate that a problem was encountered while dealing with a request carrying integrity fields and integrity preference fields.\r\n\r\nFor example, a request message may include content alongside Content-Digest and Repr-Digest header fields that use a digest algorithm the server does not support. An application could decide to reject this request because it cannot validate the integrity. Using a problem type, the server can provide machine-readable error details to aid debugging or error reporting.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\r\nContent-Type: application/problem+json\r\n\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"https://iana.org/assignments/http-problem-types#unsupported-hashing-algorithm\",\r\n  \"title\": hashing algorithm is not supported,\r\n  \"unsupported-algorithm\": \"foo\",\r\n  \"supported-algorithms\": [\"sha-256\", \"sha-512\"]\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n```",
